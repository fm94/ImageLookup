# ImageLookup

This is a fast algorithm to use as follows:
- you have an image or a patch
- you have tons of other images (like a database)
- run the algo and it will tell you where did you image or patch come from

# How to run it?
- place your image database (images) in `sources`
- place your query images in `queries`
- run the following:
```
python image_lookup.py
```
- enjoy!

you can of course check other parameters, which are defined in the argparsed in `utils.py`
